			<h1><b> Greetings, </b></h1>
			<h3 id="bigID"><i>Welcome to my first site.</i> </h3>
			<p> My name is Olivia.</p>
			<h3 id="bigID"> Introduction: About Me </h3>
			<p> Growing up, I've always had a bulging intuition for matters that would easily be missed by others in the crowd. It could either be an elephant in the room, or a certain way an individual is feeling that could only be read by the expression in their eyes. In this day and age, speaking from the heart has seem to become a rarity; something that is only found in people who are perceived to be "in touch" with themselves. It isn't necessarily an issue for one to be blamed, rather, we must aid in the progression of one another to open up to our desirable "true" selves. Additionally, to open the doors that will allow us to express our emotions on a level of raw honesty.</p>

			<h3> Why code? </h3>
			<p> As a visual and hands on learner, I would like to discover where my imagination can take me into the digital world. I am intrigued by all of the possibilities that coding can bring to life on any aspect of creation, whether it be medically, gaming or analytics. While I believe life is incredibly precious and time should be spent wisely... I am taking this path into pursuing an education at devCodeCamp to further my journey into discovering more about myself as an individual, and what I am capable of. To conclude, I believe coding will allow me step out of my comfort zone and truly grow as a person as I approach trial and error. </p>
