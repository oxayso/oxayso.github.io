            <p> A friend once said to me, <i>"You're already incredibly smart and involving yourself more into what is technical would impress me endlessly when that's what you choose to do. Anything. I know I haven't been the best presence but I'm singin' to ya because you help me see the brighter things and with that much, I already know there's no end to your preciousness. That's what you choose to surround yourself with, these brighter things, and I have a ton of respect for that- it comes as no surprise to me that that's what you strive for, that greatness and profundity. That's so incredibly rare... do you know that? You're as special as you are great. Just a reminder."</i> This led to the confirmation in the fact that when you surround yourself with uplifting individuals, goals seem easier to reach. I was finally able to open up and implement my ideas to aid in the growth of relationships an friendships around me. To be able to connect with one another is extremely beautiful to me, whether it be virtually, mentally, spiritually or physically. Connection is one of the most intricate actions in my world.. in which I believe, cannot be replaced by anything else.</p>

            <h1> <center> Aspire to Inspire</h1></center>
            <p> I aspire to bring beauty, color, happiness, and pleasure into the lives of others. I'm led to believe that I possess a natural sense of harmonious rhythm which enables me to express myself freely and fluently. However, my love of romance, play, and pleasure are both advantages and disadvantages. Although, it is great to know how to play and enjoy life, I find that I need to remind myself to try not to fritter away all of my time.
