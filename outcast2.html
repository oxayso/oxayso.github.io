        <center><h3 id="bigID"> Outcast or Introvert? </h3></center>
        <p> I've always had trouble distinguishing what I was... but it has all narrowed down into a perspective rather than a category. In the midst of it all underlies an aspect of beauty that many so-called "outcasts" or "introverts" embody. While it is possible that this layer of beauty may be embedded deep within, there are moments where it will come to surface when the individual is driven, and motivated to take action on the bulging intuition. Coincidentally, growing up I began to consider myself one of these beautifully destructed and motivated outcasts. I have always been the quiet one in the back of the room with different thoughts on subjects, yet it was unusual when I would feel afraid to speak up. My insight would have only been open to the select few of adults in my life, in which I would consider the rarity: someone who we only encounter at the right time, in the right place... and in that moment, I would feel a sense of satisfaction and compassion.</p>

        <center><h3 id="bigID"> In a nutshell </h3></center>
        <p> I have always felt compassionate for all human beings. Especially those who are unable to put their abilities to their highest potential of use. I have made the decision to begin assisting in as many volunteer activities as possible because I love being able to provide an extra helping hand, and I enjoy helping people recover from any condition that it may be. More so, I love to learn about the human body system, whether it be in the aspect of communication or mobility. I strongly love seeing others improve, happy and healthy. With my volunteerism, it makes me feel good as a person. I know that I am doing something that is benefitting the community, and there are no regretful decisions made in my act of kindness! </p>
