			<h1 id="bigID"> Surround yourself with goal-driven people </h1>
			<p> A friend once said to me, "You're already incredibly smart and involving yourself more into what is technical would impress me endlessly when that's what you choose to do. Anything. I know I haven't been the best presence but I'm singin' to ya because you help me see the brighter things and with that much, I already know there's no end to your preciousness. That's what you choose to surround yourself with, these brighter things, and I have a ton of respect for that- it comes as no surprise to me that that's what you strive for, that greatness and profundity. That's so incredibly rare... do you know that? You're as special as you are great. Just a reminder." This led to the confirmation in the fact that when you surround yourself with uplifting individuals, goals seem easier to reach.</p>

			<h1> I Aspire to... </h1>
			<p> I aspire to bring beauty, color, happiness, and pleasure into the lives of others. I'm led to believe that I possess a natural sense of harmonious rhythm which enables me to express myself freely and fluently. However, my love of romance, play, and pleasure are both advantages and disadvantages. Although, it is great to know how to play and enjoy life, I find that I need to remind myself to try not to fritter away all of my time.
